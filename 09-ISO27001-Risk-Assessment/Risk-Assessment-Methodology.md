# Information Security Risk Assessment Methodology

## Purpose

This document defines the methodology used by BlueSky Technologies to identify, 
analyze, evaluate, and prioritize information security risks as part of the ISMS.

This methodology supports ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Clause 6.1.2 requirements for 
information security risk assessment.

---

## Risk Identification

Information security risks are identified by considering:

- Information assets
- Business processes
- Technology dependencies
- Internal and external context
- Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements
- Previous audit findings and control observations

Examples:

- User accounts
- Customer data
- AWS infrastructure
- Production systems
- Third-party integrations

---

## Risk Analysis Approach

Each identified risk is evaluated based on:

### Likelihood

The probability that a threat could exploit a vulnerability.

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Rare |
| 2 | Unlikely |
| 3 | Possible |
| 4 | Likely |
| 5 | Almost certain |

### Impact

The potential business impact if the risk occurs.

Impact considers:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Customer impact
- Regulatory impact

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Low |
| 3 | Medium |
| 5 | High |

---

## Risk Calculation

Risk rating is calculated as:

Likelihood × Impact

Example:

Likelihood: 3  
Impact: 5  

Inherent Risk:

3 × 5 = 15

---

## Risk Evaluation

Risk ratings are categorized:

| Score | Rating |
|---|---|
| 1-5 | Low |
| 6-10 | Medium |
| 11-25 | High |

Higher-rated risks require additional review and treatment decisions.

## Risk Treatment Approach

For risks requiring treatment, BlueSky selects one of the following options:

### Reduce

Apply controls to decrease likelihood or impact.

Example:
Implement MFA to reduce account compromise risk.

### Accept

Management accepts the remaining risk.

Example:
Low-impact risk with disproportionate remediation cost.

### Avoid

Stop the activity creating the risk.

Example:
Disable an unnecessary exposed service.

### Share

Transfer part of the risk.

Example:
Cyber insurance or contractual transfer.

---

## Risk Ownership

Each risk is assigned:

- Risk owner responsible for accepting and managing the risk
- Action owner responsible for implementing treatment activities

---

## Risk Review Frequency

Risk assessments are reviewed:

- At planned intervals
- When significant changes occur
- After major incidents
- When new technologies or business processes are introduced
